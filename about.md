I am an Associate Professor of Psychology at [Quinnipiac University](http://quinnipiac.edu) and also their Director of General Education. As perhaps part and parcel of the modern era, I continually find myself with an increasingly number of  'tasks' to accomplish and less time to think. 

These pages are an attempt to ensure adequate reflection in my work-life by scheduling 'strategic reserve' time into my daily workflow.
