`Many of our activities are like housekeeping in a dream. Delirious with fever, one does not recognize the fever.`
-Patrul Rinpoche

As perhaps part and parcel of the modern era, I continually find myself with an increasingly number of things to do and less time to think. 

These pages are an attempt to ensure adequate reflection in my work-life by scheduling 'strategic reserve' time into my daily workflow.
